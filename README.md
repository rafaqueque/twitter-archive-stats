# Twitter Archive stats
Twitter is releasing everyone's tweets, so why not use the information to gather some data about it? 

# Usage
You need to download your Twitter Archive first. Go to Settings and request the download. After that, extract to wherever you want. If you want to see them in a Twitter-like way, just run index.html.
To get a few stats, like the number of tweets, replies or retweets, just run the command below:
  
  php run.php /path/to/tweets.csv

# To-do 
I don't know, but I'll add something later. It's just the initial commit.
